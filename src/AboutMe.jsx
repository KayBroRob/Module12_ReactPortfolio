             Hi! My name is Kaylyn Robinson. 
             I graduated from the University of Central Florida with my Bachelor's of Science degree in Entertainment and Event Management. 
              I currently work for Google as a Senior Level Event Manager. 
              I decided to join this coding bootcamp with the intention of eventually switching career fields. 
              Someday, I would like to work in coding and programing for a company that works with the artists.
